# Virtualbox installation in Linux not recognising conencted USB drives despite presence of extension pack

To root some android devices, you will need to have a Windows installation.
Install Windows 10 in virtualbox. 
You may get an error of your device not being recognised by virtualbox itself.
Open a terminal in linux and check with "vboxmanage list usbhost"
If there is no output you have to add your user to the Vbox users group.
  Run "sudo usermod -G vboxusers -a $USER"
Reboot your pc and BOOM!!
